 * This is an abstract class for the quality indicators calculators. The idea is

 * order to perform an exact normalization. This internal population is used for
 * assessing the max and min values for the normalization. It is useful when you
 * don't know what are these values and must use the max known and min known
 * values.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * If the intention is to compare the fronts A, B and C, then the
 * addParetoFront() method must be invoked three times giving A, B and then C as
 * input.
